## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}` and `{% url 'home' %}`  
it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files.

Usually in order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Some of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated,
and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application. In total there are twenty tests.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal:

`python3 manage.py test`

## Bugs

**Fixed Bugs**

When submitting the reservation form the user / admin received a feedback message informing them of an invalid data type submission. On review of the reservation model, the GUESTS tuple had strings in the tuples and these were assigned to choices in the integer field of the number of guests. To resolve this error integers were coded instead of strings in the GUESTS tuple of tuples.

**Open Issues**



## Unfixed Bugs

There is a known bug in the menu list page. When there are three dishes in the starters row and admin posts a fourth dish, this new post pushes an earlier post to the next row and it takes up the entirety of the new row making it larger than the other posts.
This bug may be propagated to the main and desserts rows.

There is a known bug in the menu list page. In the menu_list.html file the three for loop counters are not all divisable by three. To get all the posts displaying in a row. Different values were used for the for loops.
